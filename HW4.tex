% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to \LaTeX{} to determine where to break
% the lines. Using \AND forces a linebreak at that point. So, if \LaTeX{}
% puts 3 of 4 authors names on the first line, and the last on the second
% line, try using \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

    \textbf{Exercise 4.5}\par
    $Proof$.
    Suppose $A_i$ whose strength is $a_i$ and $B_j$ whose strength is $b_j$ fight.After fighting,for $A_i$ we have
    $$
    E(strength_{A_i})=\frac{a_i}{a_i+b_j}\cdot (a_i+b_j)+\frac{b_j}{a_i+b_j}\cdot 0=a_i
    $$
    So after $\forall k$ wars,
    $$
    E(\sum strength_{A_i})=\sum_{i=1}^{m}a_i
    $$
    $$
    E(\sum strength_{B_j})=\sum_{j=1}^{n}b_j
    $$
    Now let's compute $E(\sum strength_{A_i})$ in a different way:\par
    Wars has only two results:Alice'team wins or Bob's team wins.\par
    The former happens with probability $p$,
    the latter with probability $1-p$.\par
    Thus
    $$
    E(\sum strength_{A_i})=(\sum_{i=1}^{m}a_i+\sum_{j=1}^{n}b_j)\cdot p+0\cdot (1-p)
    $$
    Therefore,
    $$
    p=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{m}a_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{m}a_i+\sum_{j=1}^{n}b_j}
    $$
    So the probability of Alice's team winning does not depend on the order in which Alice and Bob send their monsters into the arena.
