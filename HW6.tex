% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to \LaTeX{} to determine where to break
% the lines. Using \AND forces a linebreak at that point. So, if \LaTeX{}
% puts 3 of 4 authors names on the first line, and the last on the second
% line, try using \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

	\textbf{Exercise 6.5}\par
	For every $n\le6$, there is an asymmetric graph on $n$ vertices, like Figure $1$.
  	\begin{figure}[H]
  	\centering
  	\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{6.5.png}
  	\caption{}
  	\label{fig:1}
  	\end{figure}
	When $n=6$, the left graph is correct. When $n>6$, we just need to construct trees like right graphs. 
	There are only one vertex that has three degrees and  $n-4$ vertices are at the right of this vertex.
	 
	\textbf{Exercise 6.6}\par
	For graphs in \textbf{Exercise 6.5}, we just need to add cherries for every vertex, like Figure $2$.
	\begin{figure}[H]
  	\centering
  	\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{6.6.png}
  	\caption{}
  	\label{fig:1}
  	\end{figure}
	The graph has $3n$ vertices with $2^{n}$ automorphisms.
