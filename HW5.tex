% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to \LaTeX{} to determine where to break
% the lines. Using \AND forces a linebreak at that point. So, if \LaTeX{}
% puts 3 of 4 authors names on the first line, and the last on the second
% line, try using \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

	\textbf{Exercise 5.1}\par

\textbf{(1)} The degree of a vertex is defined as the number of edges linked to this vertex. And the score of a graph is a sequence ranking degree of all vertices from small to big.\par

\textbf{(2)} Graph score theorem states that, if we can find a graph for graph score $(d_1, \cdots ,d_{n-1},d_n)$, then we can find a graph for graph score $(d_1, \cdots ,d_{n-d_n-1},d_{n-d_n}-1,\cdots d_{n-1}-1)$, and vice versa. If we finally get graph score $(\phi)$, the graph exists.\par

\textbf{(3)} Graph score algorithm:\\
First, we get a graph score $(d_1, \cdots ,d_{n-1},d_n)$.\\
If $d_N>n-1$, we cannot find a graph. Otherwise, we add an edge from $d_n$ to $d_{n-d_n},\cdots d_{n-1}$, and check the graph score $(d_1, \cdots ,d_{n-d_n-1},d_{n-d_n}-1,\cdots d_{n-1}-1)$ after it is sorted.\\
We repeat the previous step. If the graph score finally comes to $(\phi)$, the graph exists.\par

\textbf{(4)} The most difficult part is to prove if we can find a graph for graph score $(d_1, \cdots ,d_{n-1},d_n)$, then we can find a graph for graph score $(d_1, \cdots ,d_{n-d_n-1},d_{n-d_n}-1,\cdots d_{n-1}-1)$. We can suppose there is a solution without edge between $n$ and $k$ $(n-d_n\leq k\leq n-1)$, so n must have another link with $j \ (j\leq n-d_{n-1}<k)$. As $j<k$, we know $d_j\leq d_k$, so $k$ must have edge with some point $l$ and $l\neq k$. We change the edges $(n,j)\  (k,l)$ to $(n,k)\  (j,l)$, and we add an edge between $n$ and $k$ without changing the score. In this way, we can transform the answer to make sure there is an edge from $d_n$ to $d_{n-d_n},\cdots ,d_{n-1}$. Then we delete these edges, we get a graph for score $(d_1, \cdots ,d_{n-d_n-1},d_{n-d_n}-1,\cdots d_{n-1}-1)$.\par
