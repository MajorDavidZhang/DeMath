% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to \LaTeX{} to determine where to break
% the lines. Using \AND forces a linebreak at that point. So, if \LaTeX{}
% puts 3 of 4 authors names on the first line, and the last on the second
% line, try using \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

	\textbf{Exercise 9.1}\par
    We define$f_1:N\rightarrow N$\par
    $f_1\left(0\right)=0,
    f_1\left(1\right)=1,
    \cdots,
    f_1\left(n\right)=n.
    $\par
    We define $f_2:N\rightarrow N^2$ based on this graph:
    \begin{figure}[H]
  	\centering
  	\includegraphics[width=8cm]{9_1_1.png}
  	\caption{}
  	\label{}
  	\end{figure}
    $f_2\left(0\right)=\left(0,0\right),f_2\left(1\right)=\left(0,1\right),f_2\left(2\right)=\left(1,0\right)\cdots$\par
    We define $f_3:N\rightarrow N^3$ based on this graph:
   \begin{figure}[H]
  	\centering
  	\includegraphics[width=8cm]{9_1_2.png}
  	\caption{}
  	\label{}
  	\end{figure}
    $f_2\left(0\right)=\left(0,0,0\right),f_2\left(1\right)=\left(0,0,1\right),f_2\left(2\right)=\left(0,1,0\right)\cdots$\par
    And so on, we can define $f_k,k\in N$.
    Now we can define a bijection $N\rightarrow N^*$ base on this graph:
    \begin{figure}[H]
  	\centering
  	\includegraphics[width=8cm]{9_1_3.png}
  	\caption{}
  	\label{}
  	\end{figure}
    We have $0\rightarrow f_1\left(0\right),1\rightarrow f_1\left(1\right),2\rightarrow f_2\left(0\right)\cdots$. This is a bijection $N\rightarrow N^*$.


\textbf{Exercise 9.2}\par
We can define a bijection from $\{0,1\}^N$ to $N$ as follows.\\
Given $A=(a_1,a_2,\cdots,a_n)$, $a_i \in \{0,1\}$ for $1\leq i \leq n$, let $f(A)=2^{n}+a_1 2^{n-1}+a_2 2^{n-2}+\cdots +a_n2^0-1$. For every element A in $\{0,1\}^N$, there is one $f(A)$ in $N$. For every element $a\in N$, according to the binary code, ther is one $f^{-1}(a) \in \{0,1\}^N$. So, f is a bijection from $\{0,1\}^N$ to $N$. Therefore, $\{0,1\}^N\cong N$.\\
Using the given fact that $N\times N\cong N$, it is clear that $\{0,1\}^N\cong \{0,1\}^N\times \{0,1\}^N$.\\
Using the given fact that $R\cong \{0,1\}^N$, it is clear that $R\cong R\times R$.

\textbf{Exercies 9.3}\par
Using the given fact that $R\cong \{0,1\}^N$ and the fact we proved in \textbf{9.2} that $\{0,1\}^N\cong N$, we only need to prove that $N\cong N^N$. $N^N$ is actually $N^*-\{\in\}$. Using the method of Hilbert's Hotel, it is obvious that $N^N\cong N^*$. We have proved in \textbf{9.1} that $N\cong N^*$. Therefore, $R\cong R^N$.
 




	\textbf{Exercise 9.5}\par
    $000\cdots,100\cdots,1100\cdots,11100\cdots$ According to this rule, the first $n$ bits of the $n_{th}$ sequence are $1$, and the remaining bits are $0$. Obviously, these sequences constitute a countably and infinite chain.
	
	\textbf{Exercise 9.6}\par
	$100\cdots,0100\cdots,00100\cdots,000100\cdots$ According to this rule, the $n_{th}$ bit of the $n_{th}$ sequence is $1$, and the remaining bits are $0$. Obviously, these sequences constitute a countably and infinite antichain.
	\textbf{Exercise 9.8}\par
	 We can form a bijection $f$ from ${0,1}^N$ to set $A$, which is a subset of ${0,1}^N$ as follow: Assume a string $s$ is an element of ${0,1}^N$ and  $t=f(s)$, the first k digit of $s_1 ($we call it $s_k)$determines the $(2^{k}+1)-th$ to $2^{k+1}-th $ digits of $t ($ we  call them $t_{2^k+1} to t_{2^{k+1}}$ as the following rule:\par
	 
	 	 Consider the first k digits as a binary number $a_k$, then $t_{2^k+1}$ to $t_{2^k+a_k}$ are 1 and the $t_{2^k+a_k+1}$ to $t_{2^{k+1}}$ are 0. Specially, we define that the first 2 digits of t are always $'00'$.  
	 
	 Here is an example:
	 $$
	 s=1011......
	 $$
	 $$
	 f(s)=00,10,1100,11111000,1111111111100000,......
	 $$
	 Obviously, $f$ is a bijection and A is uncountable. Also, any two elements $t_1,t_2$ of A is comparable. Assume two elements $s_1,s_2$ is different and their first different digit is the k-th digit. The k-th element of $s_1$ is 1. Then for any $m$ such that $m \ge k$,the binary number of the first m digit of $s_1$ is greater than that of $s_2$, which leads to the conclusion that the according string of $t_1$ is "greater" than $t_2$. Thus A is the chain required.
