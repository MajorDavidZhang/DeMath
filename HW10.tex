% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to \LaTeX{} to determine where to break
% the lines. Using \AND forces a linebreak at that point. So, if \LaTeX{}
% puts 3 of 4 authors names on the first line, and the last on the second
% line, try using \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

	\textbf{proof} According to \textbf{Exercise 10.8}, a particular layering is no more optimal after at moat $m$ iterations. Since a layering is at least 1-layering and at most n-latering, after at most $m*n$ iterations, there is no optimal layering, which means there is no s-t-path, the algorithm terminates.
	
	
	\textbf{Exercise 10.10}\par
	\textbf{proof} According to \textbf{Exercise 10.9},  the Edmonds-Karp algorithm terminates after nÂ·m iterations of the while-loop, which is to say, we can get the max flow $f$ after finite steps by Edmonds-Karp algorithm.
