% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to \LaTeX{} to determine where to break
% the lines. Using \AND forces a linebreak at that point. So, if \LaTeX{}
% puts 3 of 4 authors names on the first line, and the last on the second
% line, try using \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

    $(1)$As the picture shows:\par
    $(2)$Suppose the original picture is\par
    Original $A$ position now is $A'$,so original $B$ position now is the point connected with $A'$ before and there are two possibilities.\par
    If $B'$ is determined,the original $F$ position is the other point connected with $A'$ apart from $B'$.\par
    Therefore other positions is also determined for the same reason.\par
    So the number of automorphisms is $6 \times 2 = 12.$\par
    $(3)$For the same reason of $(2)$,if there are 3 points  determined , the graph is determined.\par
    So the number of automorphisms is $8 \times 3 \times 2 = 48$.


	\textbf{Exercise 6.2}\par
    The complete graph on $999$ vertices has $C_{999}^{2}$ edges.The $|E|$ is odd,so the $|E|$ of original graph and the $|E|$ of complement graph is not equal.
    So there is no self-complementary graph on $999$ vertices.
